# Training Overview

Welcome to the **International Rice Research Institute Training: SNPs to GWAS Training Course** under the Bioinformatics and IRRI Education partnership. This training is designed to equip participants with the basic bioinformatics skills necessary for performing bioinformatics analysis.

## Objective

The general objective of the training is to:

- Provide participants with the necessary **bioinformatics** skills for data manipulation, analysis, and the use of genomics-related bioinformatics software.
- Specifically, the course will focus on:
  - Training participants to use the **Linux** operating system. Performing **Linux operations** effectively.
  - Gaining hands-on experience with **bioinformatics** tools and techniques.

## Format

This is a **face to face training setup**.
